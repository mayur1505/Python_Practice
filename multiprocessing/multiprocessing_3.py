#output
# inside process [4, 9, 64]
# outside process [] 
# whenever you create a new process the new process will get its own address space at a
# space meaning the space where it stores all the variables

#see the theory in theory folder and file name is "multiprocessing_1"
#we will use shared memory for solving above issue. 
#Shared memory lives outside the processes hence we can access it. Thereâ€™s two way of using shared memory. 
#First one is value and other is array.
