    "## 🔁 **Multithreading**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple **threads** (lightweight units of a process) run **within the same process** and **share the same memory space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Best for**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I/O-bound** tasks (e.g., network calls, file operations, web scraping).\n",
    "* Tasks that spend time **waiting** for external operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧨 **Limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has a **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** which means only **one thread executes Python bytecode at a time**, even on multicore CPUs.\n",
    "* So, it does **not scale well for CPU-bound** tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low (threads share memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Example Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web crawlers\n",
    "* Logging systems\n",
    "* Download managers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 **Multiprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple **processes**, each with **its own memory space**, run **independently**. No shared memory by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Best for**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CPU-bound** tasks (e.g., computations, ML model training, image/video processing).\n",
    "* Takes full advantage of **multiple cores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💪 **Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No GIL limitation — true **parallelism**.\n",
    "* Each process runs in its **own Python interpreter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High (each process has its **own memory**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires **interprocess communication (IPC)** using `Queue`, `Pipe`, `Manager`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Example Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data science model training\n",
    "* Heavy numerical computation\n",
    "* Video encoding\n",
