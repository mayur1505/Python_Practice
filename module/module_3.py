#How to write our own custom module
#for ex. we want to create one python module, which calculates trainagle area and square area

#so below we have functions ready and we have to import them to another code as module
#for doing that we will use "import module_3"
#check module_4.py file
def calculate_traingle_area(base,height):
    return 1/2*(base*height)

def calculate_square_area(length):
    return length*length
